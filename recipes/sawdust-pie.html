         <h4>Don't let the name fool youâ€”this pie is anything but dusty. This old-fashioned dessert gets its name from the sweet, crumbly filling that looks like sawdust but tastes like a coconut pie, chess pie, and pecan pie filling in one. This pantry staple pie is easy to whip up in under two hours and is sure to be a standout on the dessert table. </h4>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie plate; fold edges over, and crimp with the tines of a fork. Poke holes evenly along the sides and bottom of pie crust with a fork. Bake in the preheated oven until pie crust is dry to the touch on the bottom and sides, about 8 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3><p>Gently fold together egg whites, flaked coconut, graham cracker crumbs, walnuts, sugar, salt, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until fully combined and a thick mixture forms, about 1 minute.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3><p>Transfer egg white mixture to prepared pie crust and gently spread it into an even layer.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3><p>Return to the oven and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until pie crust edges are golden brown and the center is set, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3><p>Slice and top with whipped cream and sliced bananas.</p>
