            <li>butter</li>
            <li>all purpose flour</li>
            <li>salt</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>To make the filling: Combine sugar, lemon juice, eggs, flour, and lemon zest together in a large mixing bowl, and whisk until well blended. Set aside.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3><p>To make the crust: Combine flour, butter, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor; pulse several times until dough begins to come together in a ball.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3><p>Divide the dough into 6 equal portions: press each portion of dough into the bottom and up the sides of nonstick 6-cup mini tart pan. Spoon lemon filling into each crust.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3><p>Bake tarts in the preheated oven until the filling is set and the crust is lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack until mini tarts reach room temperature.</p>
